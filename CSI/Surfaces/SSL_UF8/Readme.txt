In order to use the SSL UF8 with Reaper its buttons need to be customised because the basic DAW profile in SSL 360 does not map all the buttons to the surface.

To make a start please load the included SSL 360 XML settings file into your UF8. Please note that the buttopns are mapped as follows:

SEND / PLUGIN 1 to 8: F1 to F8
QUICK 1: GLOBAL (QUICK 2 and 3 are unassigned)
CHANNEL: GLOBAL
< (Page L): Folder (CSI Folder Zone)
> (Page R): VCA (CSI VCA Zone)
PAN: Undo
AUTOMATION OFF: Shift

All other mappings are labelled and their function is visible on the controller displays.
